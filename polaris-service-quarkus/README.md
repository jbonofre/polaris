This module contains the Polaris Service powered by Quarkus (instead of Dropwizard as in `polaris-service`).
This module contains the Polaris Service (server) 

# Main differences

* Bean injection (CDI) is made using `@ApplicationScoped` annotation on class and injected in other classes using `@Inject` annotation (https://quarkus.io/guides/cdi-reference). Dropwizard injection json 
* Codehale metrics registry and opentelemetry boilerplate (prometheus exporter included) are not needed anymore: Quarkus provides it "out of the box" (https://quarkus.io/guides/opentelemetry)
* `PolarisHealthCheck` is not needed anymore: Quarkus provides it "out of the box" (https://quarkus.io/guides/smallrye-health)
* `TimedApplicationEventListener` and the `@TimedApi` annotation are replaced by Quarkus (micrometer) `@Timed` annotation (https://quarkus.io/guides/telemetry-micrometer)
* `PolarisJsonLayoutFactory` is not needed anymore: Quarkus provides it by configuration (using `quarkus.log.*` configuration)
* `PolarisApplication` is not needed, Quarkus provide a "main" application out of the box (it's possible to provide `QuarkusApplication` for control the startup and also using `@Startup` annotation)
* CORS boilerplate is not needed anymore: Quarkus supports it via configuration (using `quarkus.http.cors.*` configuration)
* CLI is not part of `polaris-service` anymore, we have (will have) a dedicated module (`polaris-cli`)

# Build and run

To build `polaris-service-quarkus` you simply do:

```
./gradlew :polaris-service-quarkus:build
```

The build creates ready to run package:
* in the `build/quarkus-app` folder, you can run with `java -jar quarkus-run.jar`
* the `build/distributions` folder contains tar/zip distributions you can extract  

You can directly run Polaris service (in the build scope) using:

```
./gradlew :polaris-service-quarkus:quarkusRun
```

You can directly build a Docker image using:

```
./gradlew :polaris-service-quarkus:imageBuild
```

# Configuration

The main configuration file is not the `application.properties`. The default configuration is package as part of the `polaris-service-quarkus`.
`polaris-service-quarkus` uses several configuration sources (in this order):
* system properties
* environment variables
* `.env` file in the current working directory
* `$PWD/config/application.properties` file
* the `application.properties` packaged in the `polaris-service-quarkus` application

It means you can override some configuration property using environment variables for example.

By default, `polaris-service-quarkus` uses 8181 as HTTP port (defined in the `quarkus.http.port` configuration property).

You can override it with, for example if you want to use 8282 port number:

```
export QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=8282 ; java -jar build/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
```

You can find more details here: https://quarkus.io/guides/config

# TODO

* Modify `CallContext` and remove all usages of ThreadLocal, replace with proper context propagation.
* Complete utests/itests in `polaris-service-quarkus`
* Remove dropwizard references (in `polaris-core` and `polaris-service-quarkus`)
* Remove `@TimedApi` from `polaris-core` (`org.apache.polaris.core.resource.TimedApi`)
* Remove `polaris-service` and rename `polaris-service-quarkus` as `polaris-service`
* Create `polaris-cli` module
* Update documentation/README/...

* Do we want to support existing json configuration file as configuration source ?
